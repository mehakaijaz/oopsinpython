    - Client object is added to the bank's database.

-Authentication:
  - If the user chooses to open an existing account:
    - Prompts for name and account number for authentication.
    - Inputs are passed to the `authentication` method of the `Bank` class.
    - If credentials exist in the bank database, a `current_client` variable is created.
