# Employee Management System

## Objective
The objective of this project is to develop a command-line Employee Management System using Python that allows a company to manage information about their employees and departments using object-oriented programming (OOP) and data structures.

## Requirements
Python and OOPS concepts

### Employee Class
- Create an `Employee` class with attributes for name, ID, title, and department.
- Include a method to display employee details.
- Implement a string representation method that returns the employee's name and ID.

### Department Class
- Create a `Department` class with attributes for department name and a list of employees.
- Include methods to add an employee, remove an employee, and list all employees in the department.

### Data Structure for Company
- Use a dictionary to represent the company, with department names as keys and `Department` objects as values.
- Implement functions to add a department, remove a department, and display all departments.

### User Interaction
- Write a function that prints a menu for the user to interact with the Employee Management System (e.g., Add Employee, Remove Employee, Display Department, etc.).
- The user should be able to add employees to departments, remove employees, and view department details.

### Data Persistence (Optional â€“ understanding the knowledge of streams)
- Save the company data to a file and load it back into the system on startup. (This can be plain text, JSON, or any other format you deem appropriate.)

## Usage
To use the Employee Management System, follow these steps:
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Run the main Python script (`main.py`).
3. Follow the instructions in the command-line interface to interact with the system.
